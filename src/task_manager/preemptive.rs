//! # Preemptive Task Scheduler
//!
//! This module implements preemptive multitasking for Martos RTOS, providing hardware-assisted
//! task switching through timer interrupts. Unlike cooperative scheduling, tasks can be
//! interrupted and switched automatically, improving system responsiveness and fairness.
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The preemptive scheduler uses hardware timer interrupts to enforce time-slicing between tasks.
//! Each task runs in its own thread with a dedicated stack, and context switches occur
//! transparently through interrupt service routines.
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - [`Thread`] - Represents a single task thread with dedicated stack and saved context
//! - [`PreemptiveTaskManager`] - Manages multiple threads using round-robin scheduling
//! - Hardware abstraction via [`Port`] trait for architecture-specific context switching
//!
//! ## Context Switching Process
//!
//! 1. **Timer Interrupt**: Hardware timer triggers an interrupt
//! 2. **Save Context**: Current task's CPU registers are saved to its [`TrapFrame`]
//! 3. **Schedule**: Next task is selected using round-robin algorithm
//! 4. **Restore Context**: New task's registers are loaded from its [`TrapFrame`]
//! 5. **Resume Execution**: New task continues from where it was interrupted
//!
//! ## Memory Management
//!
//! Each thread receives its own stack allocated at creation time:
//! - Stack size: [`THREAD_STACK_SIZE`] bytes (currently 1024)
//! - Memory layout: C-compatible with proper alignment
//! - **Note**: Stack deallocation is not yet implemented
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Task Registration
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use martos::task_manager::{TaskManager, TaskManagerTrait};
//! use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicU32, Ordering};
//!
//! static COUNTER: AtomicU32 = AtomicU32::new(0);
//!
//! fn setup_task() {
//!     println!("Task initialized");
//! }
//!
//! fn main_task() {
//!     let count = COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
//!     println!("Task iteration: {}", count);
//! }
//!
//! fn stop_condition() -> bool {
//!     COUNTER.load(Ordering::Relaxed) >= 100
//! }
//!
//! // Register preemptive task
//! TaskManager::add_task(setup_task, main_task, stop_condition);
//! TaskManager::start_task_manager();
//! ```
//!
//! # Safety Considerations
//!
//! ## Memory Safety
//! - Dynamic stack allocation without corresponding deallocation
//! - Unsafe access to global `TASK_MANAGER` instance
//! - Raw pointer manipulation for stack management
//!
//! ## Concurrency Safety
//! - Single-core design - not suitable for SMP systems
//! - No protection against data races between tasks
//! - Shared mutable state requires careful synchronization
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - **Memory leaks**: Stack memory is never freed
//! - **Single-core only**: No SMP support
//! - **No priorities**: Simple round-robin scheduling only  
//! - **Fixed stack size**: All tasks use same stack size
//!
//! # Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **Time complexity**: O(1) task switching
//! - **Space complexity**: O(n) where n is number of tasks
//! - **Interrupt overhead**: Context save/restore on each timer interrupt
//! - **Fair scheduling**: Equal time slices for all tasks
//!
//! # See Also
//!
//! - [`cooperative`] - Alternative cooperative scheduler
//! - [`TaskManagerTrait`] - Common interface for all schedulers
//! - [`Port`] - Hardware abstraction layer
